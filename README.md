## Reflection
Through coursework in social and cultural awareness, I've developed empathy and compassion for others.  
As someone who once supported political leaders who later betrayed public trust, I've come to understand the value of active listening and standing up for the marginalized. These lessons fuel my passion not only for technology but for building inclusive digital communities.
